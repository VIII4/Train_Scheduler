Next Arrival and Minutes Away



if current time is less than first train time:

next arrival is equal to first train
minutes away is diff between next arrival and current time

ct = current time
ft = first time
a = next time
b = frequency

a = ft
IF (ct < a)
    return a
else
    while(a < ct)
        a += b
    return a
